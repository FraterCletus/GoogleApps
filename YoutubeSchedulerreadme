Here's a summary of what this code does:

    It sets up the OAuth2 client with your client ID, client secret, and the redirect URI. Make sure that the client ID and client secret match the credentials you've configured in your Google Cloud Console project.

    It defines a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) data string, which seems to represent a list of scheduled events with details such as the schedule date, topic, description, and YouTube Shorts ideas.

    The TSV data is split into individual lines, creating an array of strings.

    The createEvents function, which is async, is defined to create events based on the TSV data.

    Inside the createEvents function, a loop iterates through each line of the TSV data, splitting it into date, summary, and description.

    For each event, an event object is created with details like the event summary, description, start and end date, and time zone.

    The calendar.events.insert method is called to insert the event into the primary calendar.

    If an error occurs during the event creation, it's logged, and if successful, the event link is logged.

    Finally, the main function is defined, which would typically include user authorization code. This code might include opening a web page for the user to sign in and authorize the application.

    The main function calls createEvents after successful user authorization.

Please ensure that your OAuth application gets verified by Google. Once verified, you can proceed with the authorization process and use this code to create events on Google Calendar.
Additionally, Firebase, Google APIs and other software needs to be added to make this application work. A bit of troubleshooting is worth the time!
